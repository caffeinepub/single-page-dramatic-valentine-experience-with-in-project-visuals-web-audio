  "summary": "Diff shows some initial state/setup suggesting work toward making the “No” button visible and movable (e.g., initial noPosition set away from “Yes” and new refs for container/button), but the provided excerpts are truncated before any rendering, positioning CSS, movement bounding, or attempt-message escalation logic can be verified. As a result, key acceptance criteria cannot be confirmed from the diff evidence provided.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Ensure the “No” button is visibly rendered immediately during the question phase and does not start overlapped/hidden behind the “Yes” button.",
      "reason": "The diff excerpt shows initial state `noPosition` set to `{ x: 70, y: 50 }`, but does not include the JSX layout for the question phase or any confirmed CSS/z-index/positioning rules proving both “Yes” and “No” are simultaneously visible and non-overlapping across viewports.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-16",
      "requirement": "Constrain the “No” button’s evasive movement to remain within the visible bounds of the question button area so it cannot move off-screen or under other UI (including the footer).",
      "reason": "Although refs for a buttons container and the No button exist (suggesting intent to compute bounds), the truncated diff does not show the hover handler/movement algorithm nor any container sizing/overflow rules that guarantee the “No” button stays fully within the visible button area.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-17",
      "requirement": "Fix the “No” button attempt counter/message escalation logic so dramatic messages trigger at the intended attempt counts during the question phase (no stale state issues).",
      "reason": "State variables (`noAttempts`, `dramaticMessage`, `noScale`) are present, but the truncated diff does not show the increment/update logic (e.g., functional `setNoAttempts(prev=>...)`) or the conditional milestones for message escalation, so the off-by-one/stale state fix cannot be verified.",
